RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR USING HASHING
I am very much pleased by the concept of Array of Pointers and how hashing is implemented with them.
That's i am implementing a very interseting concept of generating unique random numbers every time using hashing.
CONCEPT:
I have generated random numbers using rand() function. The statement >>struct node * bucks[33]<< defines an array of pointers.
Each pointer in this array points to the linked list associated with that bucket.
For Eg:-
bucks[0]->linked list holding numbers from 0 to 1000 and so on...
While generating random no. first, checking in hash table if it exist we again produce a new no. else we will display the no. and store it in appropriate bucket. 
Thank you

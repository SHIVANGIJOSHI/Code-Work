THE PROGRAM FOR MY OWN CRYPTOGRAPHY SYSTEM
This was made in my first semester winter vacation.
This program involves CAESAR CIPHER concept with my own twist:).
The concept used was very basic, i made this program for fun while learning cryptography from KHAN ACDEMY...
SUPER PASSWORD : 2511
SYSTEM PASSWORD: 1603
I altered this program for it to run in my operating system UBUNTU 18.04.
PROGRAMMING CONCEPT:
1)ENCRYPTION
I/P:KILL
O/P:VHAA
CONCEPT:	K	I	L	L
ASCII           76      74      77      77
DECIMAL         11	9	12	12
SHIFT
(KEY=19)	30	28	31	31
MOD26    	4	2	5	5
TO ASCII	69	67	70	70
CHARACTERS	D	B	E	E
ENCODE		V	H	A	A
1)DECRYPTION
I/P:VHAA
O/P:KILL
CONCEPT:	V	H	A	A
DECODE		D	B	E	E
ASCII           69	67	70	70
DECIMAL         4	2	5	5
SHIFT
(26-KEY=19)	11	9	12	12
MOD26    	11	9	12	12
TO ASCII	76      74      77      77
CHARACTERS	K	I	L	L
